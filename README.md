# activeusers

Recently I was discussing with a friend a problem he was having with a new product launch at his company--a large Canadian bank. The product was a self-serve platform in which customers could manage their own investment portfolio with access to all major stocks on TSX, TSX-V, S&P500, DOW, etc. 

They were seeing a lot of uptake in new users on the platform, however a deeper dive on the data revealed a lot of these users weren't actually very engaged with the product as activity was quite low.

The below is my approach to quantifying this problem and a proposed solution:
1. Separating users with low TOS (time on site/time on platform) and high TOS
2. Visualizing demographic differences between the two groups
3. Targeting the existing customer base that more closely fit high-TOS customers
